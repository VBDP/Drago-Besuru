Setting up Webbed Wings by BurnsToShine:

1. Install the VRC Fury plugin from Github (https://github.com/VRCFury/VRCFury).
2. Drag and drop the "bts_webbed_wings" prefab onto your avatar in the hierarchy.
3. Position the wings on the back of your avatar.

Animations, menu and parent to chest bone will be automatically added through the VRC Fury plugin during avatar upload.
After that, you should see a new menu in the Expression Menu called "Wings Control", where you can toggle the wings on and off, customization and control them using a radial menu.
